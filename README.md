## User Stories
  - It was a very enjoyable challenge specially because I had not previus experience in Swift,
    but after the pre-work I feel more confidence, I have learned some of the good bases, 
    I will definately enjoy to be part of new challenges in the class.






The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

-* It was my first interaction with Swift, gitHup & Slack 
   gitHup in special was a little confuse at the begining, 
   also LiceCap has not good resolution to record image, so it was a
   challenge to record a good demo without it.
