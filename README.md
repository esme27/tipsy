# Pre-work - *tipsy*

**tipsy** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Esmeralda Romero**

Time spent: **35** hours spent in total

## User Stories
It was a very enjoyable challenge especially because I had no previous experience in Swift,
but after the pre-work I feel more confidence, I have learned some of the good basics, 
I definitely will enjoy being part of new challenges in the class.



The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations
* [x] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [x] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
  - [x] Backround image
  - [x] AppIcon
  - [x] Welcome Animation Launch Screen

Additionally here is a QuickTime movie recording of using the app (to better display of the background image):

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It was my first interaction with Swift, GitHub & Slack.  GitHub especially was a little confusing at the beginning.  Also LiceCap does not record a high-enough resolution image, so it was a challenge to record a good demo.
